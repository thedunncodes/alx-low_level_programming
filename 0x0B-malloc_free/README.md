0x0B-malloc_free

0-create_array.c - to store an array of chars or strings into a "size_type" with the help of malloc. (Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.)
 
1-strdup.c - This more like copies a string into a pointer using malloc 
Note: when using "strlen" specify a return value before it incase the string which we want to get its lenght doesnt have anything in it i.e a NULL. its much safer to prevent a segmentation fault. you can see an example in this code (a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.)
